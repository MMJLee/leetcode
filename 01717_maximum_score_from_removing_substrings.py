# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-24

# You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

# Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
# For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
# Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
# For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
# Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
# Output: 19
# Explanation:
# - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
# - Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
# - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
# - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
# Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
# Output: 20
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# 1 <= x, y <= 104
# s consists of lowercase English letters.



# Get rid of all the higher points, then get rid of all the lower points

class Solution:
    def maximumGain(self, s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        # Ensure "ab" always has higher points than "ba"
        if x < y:
            s = s[::-1]
            x, y = y, x

        a_count, b_count, total_points = 0, 0, 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == "a":
                a_count += 1
            elif s[i] == "b":
                if a_count > 0:
                    a_count -= 1
                    total_points += x
                else:
                    b_count += 1
            else:
                total_points += min(b_count, a_count) * y
                a_count = b_count = 0

        total_points += min(b_count, a_count) * y

        return total_points
